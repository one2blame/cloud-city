Join me as we take a trip through Cloud City, Bespin! We'll discuss concepts
such as:

- Systems engineering
- Systems administration
- Networking
- Distributed systems
- Security
- Infrastructure automation
- Cloud architecture

All of these concepts will be covered in the context of cloud native
application development, along with a generous amount of diagrams, citations,
and references.

    single time."
